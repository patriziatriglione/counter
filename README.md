#### Description
This application is a counter that allows you to add or remove a number, to reset everything and, thanks to an additional button, allows you to have or not negative numbers, thanks also to the help of a spy.
For its realization only the javascript language was used with the addition of CSS for the graphic part.
As for the graphic part, I decided to design the counter taking a nintendo switch as an example, trying to make it a little more particular.

#### Istructions and examples 
The counter looks like this: 
- on the left the button to add

- in the center the screen, a light and two buttons. The first button is used to reset the counter while the other activates or deactivates the use of negative numbers.   When the light is on it means that we can also use negative numbers, if it is off the counter will stop at 0.

- on the right the button to remove.
